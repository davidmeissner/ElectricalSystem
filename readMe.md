# Aircraft Power Network

## The race to develop more electric aircraft is forcing design changes at the system level and increasing the need for simulation.  Balancing the tradeoff of model fidelity and simulation speed is key to effective simulation.  Models that include only the necessary effects and use the appropriate simulation mode (continuous, discrete, phasor) make your development process more efficient, ensuring that you can test your design under a wide range of conditions.  Using Model-Based Design, you can optimize system-level performance and be confident that your system will meet all requirements.

Integrate requirements into your development process
