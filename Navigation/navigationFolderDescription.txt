Files needed to navigate the demo. For CDA, it might be a published MATLAB 
file. For LTC or SPC, it might be a MATLAB file to run by   
section or a MATLAB file that calls each file in the Task folder. 
This template includes demoScript.m which is published and opened when you 
open the project by projectStartup.m and openHTML.m.

I have found other useful ways AEs navigate demos, including a Word 
document saved as an html, or straight html code.

Some AEs prefer using the Simulink Project shortcuts but have mentioned 
additional documentation may be needed to assist new users of your       
demo in this case.

Craig Borghesani wrote a series of scripts that publishes a MATLAB file 
without having to restrict yourself to the syntax requirements of the 
publish command. Check out the file script2html.m, and related files, in 
the Navigation\Script2html folder for more info.
