Files related to each component of the demo with one subfolder for each 
component, e.g. one folder, called CAD, for all the CAD files for the demo,
 or another folder, called Libraries, for all the +Libraries needed to 
build your Simscape components for the demo. The folder structure within 
the Component folder will vary widely. The intent is to make it easy for
 someone new to the demo to pick it up quickly and reduce the amount of 
time the owner spends fielding questions on his/her demo.
